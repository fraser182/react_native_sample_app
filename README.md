## React Native Demo App 1

# Setup 

You need to setup an API key for Videos.js line 19 - you will see my sample key at the end of the URL (which will not work).
Replace with your own key, which should connect to Youtube API V3.

Make sure you have the main installs including React Native CLI from
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Can be run through XCode on Mac
